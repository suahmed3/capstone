Help me format this in a way that it will allow me to create visualisations in Tableau showing Exit, Entry, and LNG export volumes

I'll first inspect the structure of your file to understand its format and then clean or reshape it for easy visualization in Tableau. Let me take a look.

Your dataset contains the following structure:

Borderpoint: The location of gas flow.
Exit and Entry: The country of gas exit and entry.
MAXFLOW (Mm³/h): Maximum flow capacity.
Monthly Data (Oct-08 to Dec-24): Gas flow volumes for different months.
Reshaping for Tableau
To create effective visualizations in Tableau, the dataset should be in long format, with columns:

Borderpoint
Exit
Entry
Month
Flow Volume
I'll now reshape the data accordingly. ​​

The dataset has been reshaped, but there was an issue converting the month column to datetime format. It seems like some non-monthly data might be interfering. I'll investigate further and fix it. ​​

It seems like I can’t do more advanced data analysis right now. Please try again later.

However, I suspect the issue with the "Month" column is that some non-date columns (like "MAXFLOW (Mm³/h)") were included when reshaping the data. You can check this by filtering out non-date columns before melting.

If you want, you can try opening the dataset in Excel and verify the unique values in the "Month" column. Let me know how you'd like to proceed! ​
