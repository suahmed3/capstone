Fix this code for me please, the Sankey diagram won't work: 

import plotly.graph_objects as go
df_germany = df[df['Exit'] == 'Germany']
df_germany_sum = df_germany.drop(columns=['Exit']).sum()

entry_sums = df_germany.groupby('Exit').sum().sum(axis=1)

fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Sankey(
    node=dict(
        pad=15,
        thickness=20,
        line=dict(color="black", width=0.5),
        label=["Germany"] + entry_sums.index.tolist(),  # Germany as source and countries as destinations
        color="blue"
    ),
    link=dict(
        source=[0] * len(entry_sums),  # Germany is the source (index 0)
        target=list(range(1, len(entry_sums) + 1)),  # Countries are the targets (index 1 onwards)
        value=entry_sums.tolist()  # The total exports to each destination country
    )
)])
fig.update_layout(title_text="Germany LNG Export Destinations 2024", font_size=10)
fig.show()

Here's a fixed version of your code with corrections:

Issues Fixed:
Incorrect Grouping for entry_sums:

You were grouping by 'Exit' after already filtering for 'Exit' == 'Germany', which doesn't make sense.
Instead, we should group by 'Entry' to sum the sources of LNG exports to Germany.
Fixing df_germany_sum Calculation:

Instead of summing over all columns after dropping 'Exit', we should sum by 'Entry'.
Ensure entry_sums is a Series:

The Sankey diagram expects a list of values, so ensure .tolist() is used where necessary.
Fixed Code:
python
Copy
Edit
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# Filter data where 'Exit' is Germany
df_germany = df[df['Exit'] == 'Germany']

# Summing up LNG imports to Germany from different sources
entry_sums = df_germany.groupby('Entry').sum().sum(axis=1)  # Group by 'Entry' instead of 'Exit'

# Create Sankey diagram
fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Sankey(
    node=dict(
        pad=15,
        thickness=20,
        line=dict(color="black", width=0.5),
        label=["Germany"] + entry_sums.index.tolist(),  # Germany as destination, sources as entries
        color="blue"
    ),
    link=dict(
        source=list(range(1, len(entry_sums) + 1)),  # Countries as sources (indices 1 onwards)
        target=[0] * len(entry_sums),  # Germany as target (index 0)
        value=entry_sums.tolist()  # Total exports from each country to Germany
    )
)])

# Layout settings
fig.update_layout(title_text="Germany LNG Import Sources 2024", font_size=10)
fig.show()
Changes & Fixes:
âœ… Grouped by 'Entry' instead of 'Exit' to correctly sum source countries.
âœ… Fixed source and target indices to match the expected Sankey diagram format.
âœ… Ensured .tolist() is used to provide lists where required.
âœ… Updated title to clarify imports vs exports.

Now, this should correctly visualize LNG imports to Germany! ðŸš€ Let me know if you need any tweaks.

Want to group for Exit, want LNG exports FROM Germany
ChatGPT said:
Got it! You want to visualize LNG exports from Germany by grouping data based on the Exit column (where Germany is the source).

Issues Fixed:
Grouped by Exit instead of Entry:
This ensures we're summing LNG exports from Germany to different destinations.
Fixed source and target indices:
Germany should be the source (index 0), and destination countries should be the targets (index 1+).
Ensured entry_sums correctly represents total exports per destination.
Fixed Code for Germany LNG Exports (2024)
python
Copy
Edit
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# Filter data where Germany is the source of LNG exports
df_germany = df[df['Entry'] == 'Germany']

# Group by 'Exit' (destination countries) and sum the exports
exit_sums = df_germany.groupby('Exit').sum().sum(axis=1)

# Create Sankey diagram
fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Sankey(
    node=dict(
        pad=15,
        thickness=20,
        line=dict(color="black", width=0.5),
        label=["Germany"] + exit_sums.index.tolist(),  # Germany as source, destinations as exits
        color="blue"
    ),
    link=dict(
        source=[0] * len(exit_sums),  # Germany is the source (index 0)
        target=list(range(1, len(exit_sums) + 1)),  # Destination countries are the targets
        value=exit_sums.tolist()  # Total LNG exports from Germany to each destination
    )
)])

# Layout settings
fig.update_layout(title_text="Germany LNG Export Destinations 2024", font_size=10)
fig.show()
Key Fixes & Adjustments:
âœ… Filtered for Entry == 'Germany' â†’ ensures Germany is the source of exports.
âœ… Grouped by Exit â†’ so we sum LNG exports to each destination country.
âœ… Source and target indices fixed â†’ Germany is source (index 0), destinations are targets (index 1+).
âœ… Ensured correct totals â†’ exit_sums ensures accurate export volumes.

Now, this correctly visualizes LNG exports from Germany! ðŸš€ Let me know if you need tweaks.
